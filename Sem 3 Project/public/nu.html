            1. Click on the randomly appearing circles to increase your score.<br/>
            2. Every circle clicked increases the score by 50 and a new circle will appear in a random place on the screen.<br/>
            3. If you are not able to click a circle within a particular time limit, it will disappear and a new one will appear in a random place. There will be no increase in the score.<br/>
            4. This will keep going on until the song is over, at which point the game will end.<br/>
            5. You can pause the game by clicking the pause button when needed, and play it again by clicking the same button.
